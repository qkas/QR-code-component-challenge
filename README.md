## Overview

Today I decided to start training my front-end development skills with Frontend Mentor. I started this QR code component challenge since it was recommended for starting out. I went into this thinking it would be easy, but I did have a few challenges on the way.

## My process

I scoped out my materials and then started by making my HTML code. I'm alrady pretty comfortable with writing html, so I didn't have many problems with this section. I did have to research Google fonts a little bit, though. Then I dived into CSS first by addressing the fonts and colors stated in the style guide. After this I started building the card with flex display, but ran into a few problems and decided the block display would suit this project better. I then finished the box with its contents inside and struggled a little while to get the box centered on the screen. I solved this problem by using the margin: auto. I should've had realised this solution quicker. Finally, I put my version with the design side by side and tried to match the details as well as I could.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to adjust the position of the contents without flexbox, how to make a simple box for content and how to use custom Google fonts. I also learned that even simple things can take a lot more time than anticipated, even if they might seem straight-forward at first.

```css
.card {
  padding: 16px;
  border-radius: 20px;
  text-align: center;
  width: 290px;
  margin: auto;
}
```

### Continued development

In my future projects I will be utilizing what I learned to make different kinds of boxes of content.
